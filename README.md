## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned
Taking up this challenge at first look very easy until i begin the project and i find out that there's a need for a good knowledge of grid. I was struggling for hours until i get myself a tutorial video on how CSS grid work. This help me understand the project better.

I get  to know how Grid properties work better, and i am glad i was able to provide a perfect solution after few hours of taking up this challenge.


### Continued development
This been my first Frontend Mentor Challenge, i think i still have to focus my learning and practing process on CSS flexbox and Grid. I would also love to take up more challenges, the focus is to convert designs into real HTML and CSS codes.

### Useful resources
